My name is Bryan Medina (he/him) and I'm a Ph.D. candidate in [Brain and Cognitive Sciences](https://bcs.mit.edu/) at [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/), as well as a [NSF Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/resources/about-grfp/) and a [MIT Dean of Science Fellow](https://science.mit.edu/about/awards/deans-fellowship-program/). I currently work in the [Lab for Computational Audition](http://mcdermottlab.mit.edu/) and [the Fiete Lab](https://fietelab.mit.edu). Before that, I was an undergrad studying Computer Science, Cognitive Sciences, and Mathematics at the [University of Central Florida](https://www.ucf.edu/). I've also worked with [Dr. Rob Kass](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~kass/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/).

As far as my research interests go, I am broadly interested in understanding how prior experience drives representations for both perception and memory, and how these learned representations constrain our memory systems. Somethings I am thinking about: How is information represented in memory?, Do our past experiences affect encoding and retrieval of new memories?, Why are some thing so easily memory and others forgettable?, How and why do our memories degrade?, How does our perception of the world influence our memory?, How does the memory representation affect memory-guided behavior?. At large, I am interested in the interaction between perception and memory, and how they might influence each other. Currently, I am working on characterizing memory-guided behavior with [Josh McDermott](http://web.mit.edu/jhm/www/) and [Ila Fiete](https://fietelab.mit.edu/people/) through various experimental paradigms and modeling efforts.

Aside from my research, I also find much joy in giving back to my community. As someone who is a Afro-latino first generation student, I believe that it is important that I share my successes and failures with those who look and talk like I do. I've volunteered my time teaching and talking to students not only on campus, but in the community, on how to succeed as a underrepresented minority in STEM. AT MIT, I take on the role of a [BCS REF (Resource for Easing Friction and Stress)](https://bcsrefs.mit.edu). In this role, I serve as a resource to graduate students in the deparment, listening to their concerns, aiding in problem solving, and pointing them to resources on campus targeted to their needs. I'm also fairly involved with outreach efforts at MIT, particularly the MIT Summer Research Program in Biology ([MSRP](https://biology.mit.edu/program-details-bsg-msrp-bio/)) and the [Quantitative Methods Workshop](https://biology.mit.edu/outreach/quantitative-methods-workshop/), having served as a research mentor, lecturer, and "counselor". At UCF, I was the Vice President of the Cognitive Sciences Club @ UCF, a club I co-founded, and Vice President of the UCF SACNAS chapter, both organizations that continue to strive to make opportunities available to all. I also served as peer advisor through the [Academic Advancement Programs](https://academicsuccess.ucf.edu/aap/), helping students with the graduate school and fellowship process in a 1-1 capacity. I even was a [STEM Ambassador](https://stem.ucf.edu/stem-programs-at-ucf/stem-ambassadors/) at UCF.

On my off-time I enjoy biking, playing a number of instruments (typically alto saxophone or electric bass on or off campus) and making [photographs](https://www.instagram.com/by_bjm/). I also find pleasure spending tons of money on my [record collection](https://www.discogs.com/user/bj_medina/collection?page=1&limit=100&header=1&layout=big) and on clothes that look like crap. I also have a radioshow called 'Brain Waves' that airs twice a month on [WMBR](https://wmbr.org/), the MIT radio station (message me for more details). My Erdos number is 4.
