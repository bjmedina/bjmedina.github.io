My name is Bryan Medina (he/him) and I'm a Ph.D. student in [Brain and Cognitive Sciences](https://bcs.mit.edu/) at [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/), as well as a [NSF Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/resources/about-grfp/) and a [MIT Dean of Science Fellow](https://science.mit.edu/about/awards/deans-fellowship-program/). I currently work in the [Lab for Computational Audition](http://mcdermottlab.mit.edu/) and [the Fiete Lab](https://fietelab.mit.edu). Before that, I was an undergrad studying Computer Science, Cognitive Sciences, and Mathematics at the [University of Central Florida](https://www.ucf.edu/). I've also worked with [Dr. Rob Kass](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~kass/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/).

As far as my research interests go, I am broadly interested in understanding how the auditory cortex represents and transforms sounds, and how these learned representations constrain our memory systems. Somethings I am thinking about: How are natural sounds represented in memory?, Do our memory systems selectively choose certain features to store?, What happens to memory representations in time?, Are the representations stored in memory multimodal?, and Do these representations depend on task constraints?. At large, I am interested in the interaction between perception and memory, and how they might influence each other. Currently, I am working on characterizing auditory memory representations with [Josh McDermott](http://web.mit.edu/jhm/www/) and [Ila Fiete](https://fietelab.mit.edu/people/) through various experimental paradigms and modeling efforts.

Aside from my research, I also find much joy in giving back to my community. As someone who is a Latino first generation student, I believe that it is important that I share my successes with those who look and talk like I do. I've volunteered my time teaching and talking to students not only on campus, but in the community, on how to succeed as a underrepresented minority in STEM. At UCF, I was the Vice President of the Cognitive Sciences Club @ UCF, a club I co-founded, and Vice President of the UCF SACNAS chapter, both organizations that continue to strive to make opportunities available to all.

On my off-time I enjoy biking, baking, playing a number of instruments (typically alto saxophone or electric guitar) and making photographs. I also find pleasure spending tons of money on my [record collection](https://www.discogs.com/user/bj_medina/collection?page=1&limit=100&header=1&layout=big). I also have a radioshow called 'Brain Waves' that airs twice a month on [WMBR](https://wmbr.org/), the MIT radio station.
