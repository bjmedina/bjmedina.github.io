today we have a special guest, america's most hispanic goth, angelica g. angelica and i go way back, like 6th grade band class back. she would dress up in majority pink outfits (selected by her mother, of course), and was extremely organized and friendly. we sat next to each other and learned the saxophone at the same time.

however, something happened and she disappeared from my life for quite some time. she then reappeared in my life in highschool band, as a clarinetist now. but she came back as a full fledged goth. she dove herself into the world of the macabre, deeply appreciating the music, aesthetic, and history behind goth as a we know it today. her mom thought it was a phase then. it's still going strong to this day.

in honor of her and with halloween fast approaching, angelica devised a spooky playlist to get everyone in the gothic headspace for halloween, and to learn a little bit about the goth culture.
