so thankful to so many people...

{:.content-narrow .content-block}
- my [aap](https://academicsuccess.ucf.edu/aap/) family at ucf
- Emily LaPadura for her seemingly UNENDING support and willingness to always review my materials, and for also giving me the strength to keep on truckin'!
- Mark Saddler for making sure that i wasn't writing complete nonsense (and the rest of the lab for computational audition at MIT for their ideas)
- Dr. Rob Kass at CMU
- my friends and family for making sure my proposal was thought provoking and also accessible to a wide audience, and so many more.......
