I did not grow up thinking about science, or knowing I wanted to be a scientist. it wasn't until probably a year or two before i started graduate school when i realized that i wanted to go to grad school to study, in some sense, how experiences make shape us into who we are. as a result, something i enjoy doing is going out into the real world and sharing my science (and science more broadly) so that i can expose others to science (and if doing science is right for them, hopefully put them on a trajectory to do so). 

one avenue that allows me to do that is through MIT's [mcgovern institute for brain research](https://mcgovern.mit.edu), where both my advisors (josh and ila) are investigators in. they often host many events giving research in the institute (such as myself) an opportunity to share our work to a broader audience. i just wanted to share two instances in which i was sharing my science. enjoy!
