i'm a huge fan of the band IDLES. and a couple days ago, i went to go see them at the roadrunner. however, i did not expect for Injury Reserve, an experimental hip hop group to open up for them. you see, IDLES is a post punk band, and Injury Reserve, is far from that (depending on who you ask). Injury Reserve's music is definitely outside of the wheelhouse for most of IDLES' fanbase. there was a very visible disapproval from the audience when Injury Reserve played their set, and that bothered me a bit. Injury Reserve's music, though challenging, is extremely beautiful and rewarding to listen to. to go up on a stage, and perform your music to the highest degree to a crowd that visibly is not vibing with your music is extremely respectable. i believe that music is for those who listen. be open to something, and you'll find comparisons between this seemingly new sound and music that you are already used to. today's show is for injury reserve -- we will dip our toes into the world of experimental hip hop
