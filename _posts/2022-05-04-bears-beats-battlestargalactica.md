i was thinking about the office the other day... in particular the famous reference **BEARS, BEETS, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA** that came out of the show.... i dont know why but i figured that the reference would make for a great theme... so here i present a playlist with that theme

{:.content-narrow .content-block}
BEARS := folk music

{:.content-narrow .content-block}
BEETS := beats

{:.content-narrow .content-block}
BATTLESTAR GALACTICA := weird-ish, very not mainstream music

{:.content-narrow .content-block}
enjoy!
