LIFE long friend cary c. is today's guest, live from miami florida (thanks to zoom). it's finally starting to heat up in boston (for better or for worse). i think many people forgot what it's like to be in the summer heat. luckily, cary is no stranger to hot summer days, and so she provided a great playlist that encompasses all facets of summer.
