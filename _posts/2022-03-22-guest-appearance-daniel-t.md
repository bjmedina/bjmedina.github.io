what better person to have as my first ever guest than a great friend from back home (miami), Daniel T. he's in town and i really wanted to showcase his eclectic (yet beautiful) taste in music.

whenever i have guests over, i have them choose music centered around a particular theme (of their choosing). his theme is essentially songs that have one word in the title.
