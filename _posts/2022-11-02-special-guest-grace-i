today we have a special guest, grace i. for as long as i can remember, i've never once doubted grace's artistic talent. she is beyond exception at her craft (current a rising architect studying at a fancy ivy league institution). her art is of an extremely high calibar and i dont remember a time when it wasn't.

however, all of the best artists i know got a little something going on, and grace is no exception. i think grace is a maniac, in the best way possible. i don't understand how someone can eat pancakes with pesto and almonds for breakfast. i don't understand how someone can eat a mcchicken with extra mayonnaise. i don't understand how someone can go days without sleeping and then listen to screeches and call that music. grace has coined the term "sewer rat girl", and that is precisely what she is.

this playlist is for all the girls who are sewer rats.
