spotify does this thing where they can create a "blend" playlist -- a combined playlist that tries to showcase the intersection between you and a friend's music taste. it's a consensual process -- where both you and the friend have to both click buttons agreeing for spotify to create this blend.

for some reason, spotify agreed to make a blend between YODA and i (not sure how that happened). however, it got me thinking... what if we lived in an alternative universe... where yoda and i... you know... were friends... or something more... ahahaa. anyway i made a playlist that yoda and i would listen to.
