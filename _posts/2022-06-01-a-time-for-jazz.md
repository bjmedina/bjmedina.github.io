i <3 jazz. ive been listening to it for many years and i also studied it in highschool. its near and dear to my heart for a number of reasons and i'd like to share some of it with ya'll. however, this is FAR from a definitive list of essential jazz listens, these are just songs (in chronological order) that i thought would be nice for an audience who regularly listens to my show to check out.
