daniel and i met literally in kindergarten. he is a great lifelong friend, sapper, and most importantly, lover of post-punk. today, he brings to us a playlist that explores a specific point in the origins of the genre as we know it: david bowie's time in berlin.
his playlist highlights 3 selections from the various albums of the Berlin Trilogy and then tours the songs of his acolytes, featuring Tears For Fears, Ultravox, Joy Division, Devo and more. experience the inception of angst at the dawn of neoliberalism. look on our works, ye pitiful, and despair.
