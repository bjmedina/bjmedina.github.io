im not a fan of summer haha. fall is coming and i am ecstatic. however, with the fall comes a range of emotions. for instance, school is starting, which brings together much of our friends under the same roof, but with school comes responsibilities. and those responsibilities can be stressful. further, relationships with other people can be particularly complex, a function not only of the other people, but of our own mental states, among other factors. although our individual feelings our unique, we all go through difficult times, and fall seems to be a reminder of that. these songs, for me, accentuate that fall feeling.

dont be afraid to reach out for help if you need it
