today on the show i have a fantastic friend Gaby R. on the show. gaby and i are both from miami, but never met until we moved to boston (same phd program cohort!).

{:.content-narrow .content-block}
i think gaby and i immediately bonded over that fact that we're both one of the few (unfortunately) latinx students in the department. in some sense, we wanted to embrace that fact, and came up with a playlist that brings together music from a vast number of cultures, focusing on ones that are close to home for us.

enjoy!
