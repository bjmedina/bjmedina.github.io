i took this really cool/exciting class during iap (mit's winter semester). in the class, we learned how to join two worlds: the formal, theoretical, with the aesthetic, artistic. we did this by studying physical computing -- thinking about how to interface technology with the real world through art. thanks to the instructor, [the fantastic timmy lee](https://timmyhlee.com) we learned how to program arduino and give birth creative interactive artworks.

[this class was the first of it's kind at mit and mit wrote an article about it.](https://arts.mit.edu/computing-through-art/) i appear (in an image) but other students are featured. please read the article to read about their amazing works and ideas! (i made a shitty theremin, and plan to interface that with a light show -- but that's a work in progress)
