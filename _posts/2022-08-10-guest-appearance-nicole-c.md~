this week i have a guest appearance from one of bestest friends on the planet, nicole c. she is a fantastic human being, who is deeply interesting, thoughtful and nostalgic. particularly nostalgic for her time back home in california, where she always looks back on her time driving around with the music and people she loves. i think this nostalgia for a time in a car with your favorite music and people is a nearly universal feeling (at least universal for people who live in the US, maybe). today nicole presents some of the songs that she holds dearly to her heart.
