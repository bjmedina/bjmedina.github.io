my father showed me a ton of music as a kid. Pink Floyd, Guns N Roses, TOTO, Jimi Hendrix, Air Supply, The Commodores, you NAME IT. it was fantastic, HOWEVER ---- it never felt like i discovered music on my OWN. this music taste didn't feel like MINE.

that all changed when i got a TV in elementary school. this was pretty much pre-internet. i remember, in like 1st grade, i would turn on the tv in my room (after my parents tucked me in to bed) and would plug in my headphones into the headphone jack (very old tvs), and would tune on to MTV. The most salient musical experiences? Fall Out Boy (particularly the "Dance Dance" music video) and all adjacent bands. this playlist is a tribute to that time and music of that era (music i ACTUALLY listened to as a kid)
